# Snake Game
Overview

This project is a classic implementation of the Snake game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game provides a simple interface with retro-style visuals. The objective is to control the snake and collect food items, growing in size while avoiding collisions with the game board edges or the snake itself.

2. style.css: The CSS file that defines the look and feel of the game, including layout, colors, and fonts.
3. Snake.js: The JavaScript file containing the game logic, including snake movement, food generation, scoring, and user interaction.
